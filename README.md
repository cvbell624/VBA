Week 2 - VBA
The purpose of this homework is to find out which ticker has the greatest % change over the course of a quarter.
I completed this by using my resources that have been provided to me (tutor, in class help, and the xpert learning assistant). 
I conclude that AIQK has the greatest quarterly change in quarter 1, AREZ has the greatest change in quarter 2, AREZ has the greatest change in quarter 3, and ATH has the greatest change in quarter 4. Using the code makes finding these values a lot easier.
